# Neural Graph to Sequence Model

The code come from https://github.com/freesunshine0316/neural-graph-to-seq-mp
of paper [A Graph-to-Sequence Model for AMR-to-Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02473) in ACL 2018

The code is developed under TensorFlow 1.4.1. 
We shared our pretrained model along this repository. 
Due to the compitibility reason of TensorFlow, it may not be loaded by some lower version (such as 1.0.0).
